## Before

![Group J's Home Page before website update. The website is remniscent of the 90s. There is a large banner that says Group J with an ombre yellow background. There is a gold rectangle below Group J that says "Healthcare Financial Solutions". Just below that there is a black banner with some links, a wall of text and an image of some hospital staff.](/images/groupj-home.png)    ![Group J's about page is almost the same as their home page except the photo is of a hand reaching towards the camera while a flurry of papers flies around.
